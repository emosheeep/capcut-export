This project is based on [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), which is a very well-known low-level tool for cross-platform video processing. **Please manually install it and make `ffmpeg` in your `PATH` first**.

Here's the running example:

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Based on ffmpeg, which is fast and reliable.
- üí° Stream copy, without re-encoding and loss of quality.

## Quick Start

```shell
pnpm i -g capcut-export # or npm/yarn
```

Then you got `ccexp` command in you `PATH`

```
Usage: ccexp [options] <file> [output]

Export video clips from CapCut editor tracks, helps archive materials.

Arguments:
  file                      CapCut/Jianying draft info json file.
  output                    The output directory, default is cwd.

Options:
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -p,--concurrent <number>  The number of tasks processed in parallel, the default is number of CPU.
  --offset <number>         Expand the video clips' time range to both sides for about specified seconds, default is 2s.
  --verbose                 To be verbose. (default: false)
  -h, --help                display help for command
```

## Example

```shell
ccexp /path/to/draft_info.json # output video clips into current directory.
ccexp /path/to/draft_info.json ./video # output into `./video` folder.
ccexp /path/to/draft_info.json --offset 5 # expand the time range of the segment by 5 seconds on each side.
ccexp /path/to/draft_info.json -p 1 --verbose # set the concurrency to 1 and show the verbose log, usually uses to debug.
```

# Draft Info File

Search for a draft info json file in your CapCut/Jianying project folder.

## On MacOS

The file is called `draft_info.json` and is located in

```
/Users/user/Movies/CapCut/User Data/Projects/com.lveditor.draft
```

## On Windows

The file is named `draft_content.json` and the default location is:

```
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\CapCut\User Data\Projects\com.lveditor.draft\
```

# How it works

First, the tool will extract **the start time**, **the duration** of the clips, and **the video path** from the draft info file.

Then it use `ffmpeg` to export specified clips, the command is like:

```shell
ffmpeg -ss 1 -t 3 -i /path/to/input.mp4 -c copy /path/to/output.mp4 -y
```

In the above command:

- `-ss` means the start time of video.
- `-t` means the duration of the video clip.
- `-c copy` means copy media steam without re-encoding, so it's a lossless and fast process and won't lose video quality.
- `-y` means automatic confirmation when needed, used to override if a file of the same name exists.

It means *export a 3s' video clip to output.mp4 from 1s of input.mp4*, and overwrite the output file if it already exists.

# Motivation

Sometimes when we finished video edit, there‚Äôll be many clips in your editor track, and *they usually comes from a single video*. Anyway, we have a lot of video clips to export.

**Assume that you want to archive the materials**, how will you do? Just export one by one? 

Actually most of editors don‚Äôt provide this functionality such as Jianying/CapCut, even if they do, **the quality of the video will suffer after they re-encoded it**.

So we need a lossless, fast, and simple way to manage to do it, this tool is made for this. **It based on ffmpeg using stream copy without re-encoding, which won't lose quality**.

# Question

## Why is the time range of exported video clips not accurate enough?

In FFmpeg, when performing video editing or extracting, precision issues may arise due to two primary reasons:

1. **Video Keyframes**: FFmpeg uses the `-ss` option to jump to a specific timestamp, and **by default, it seeks to the nearest keyframe**. *A keyframe is a frame that can be fully decoded without the need for other frames*. Normally, a video would have a keyframe every few seconds. **If the timestamp you chose does not directly fall on a keyframe, FFmpeg will choose to start from the nearest keyframe before the chosen timestamp, which can cause precision issues**.

2. **The video's codec**: Different video codecs and container formats support precise seeking to different extents. Some formats (such as MP4 and MKV) allow relatively accurate seeking, while others may not.
